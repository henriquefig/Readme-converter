# README converter

README converter is a small app based on [Showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) to help you generate HTML versions of a full README (.md) file.

It's a small app designed for a quick conversion without the need of Javascript code or re-typing your README file in the Showdown demo.
